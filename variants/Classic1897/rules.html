<ol>
 <li>The game starts in Autumn 1897 when each player reveals which of their regular home supply centres will be their initial home supply centre by building a unit on that center.  Russia may not chose StP as their initial home supply center.</li>
 <li>The game then proceeds as normal with the exception that all centres owned after the 1899 build phase become home supply centres for the duration of the game.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Regular home supply centres that are not captured before Winter 1899 are *not* home centres in this variant.</li>
  <li>If you hold another player's initial home supply centre at the end of Winter 1899 it becomes a home supply centre for you and is not a home supply centre for the original owner.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Players are referred to by their country of origin, even if they do not own any centres within their original homeland</li>
