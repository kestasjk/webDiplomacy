<p>The creator tried to make the proportions of land territories to seas basically equivalent to regular Diplomacy, but with eight players, it had to be a little bigger.  The more he looked at the game, and try to imagine how it might play out, the more confused he got.  Hence, the name, Migraine Dip!</p>
<p>Played using regular dip rules, except that each player, at the start of the game, determines which of his three units are fleets. 20 centers to win. </p>
<p><b>Map Notes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The edge of the map is connected to the edge on the opposite side of the circle. Therefore, sea-zone "West Mystic Ocean" is adjacent to sea-zone "East Mystic Ocean", and land-zone "Nortia" is adjacent to land-zone "Antoria".</li>
<li>The land-areas "Cantaria" and "Chimara" (the half-circles) are each just one area, and they are not connected to each other.  Therefore, a unit could move from "Bilington" to "Cantaria ('A' Coast)" to "Lilington".  These land-areas have two coasts, like Spain in regular Dip.  Note that the coasts are a bit counter-intuitive. At the top, "Chimara ('A' Coast)" is on the right, while at the bottom "Chimara ('A' Coast)" is on the left. </li>
<li>Land areas "Zobaru", "Dogaru", "Lokaru" and "Sotaru" also have two coasts.</li>
<li>The twelve sets of crossing arrows on the map allow armies and fleets to pass across a narrow span of water.  They have no effect on ships in the span of water, and ships in the sea-zone have no effect on units using the crossing arrows.  A crossing arrow crosses the "Straits" in the middle, but as noted above, has no effect on ships in these areas. A unit can support across a crossing arrow normally.</li>
<li>There is no adjacency across four-way corners. Therefore, "Groach Sea" is not adjacent "Jalta", etc. "Nortia" is not adjacent to "South Majestic Ocean" or "South Turgid Ocean", etc.</li>
