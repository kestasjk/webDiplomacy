<p>In this variant you can choose which countries you want to be playable.</p><ul>

<li>You neet to put the first letter of the countries you want to play in brackets and put them in the game-name.<br>
<b>Example:</b> "Testgame (IRG)" will set up a 3-player game with Italy, Russia and Germany.</li>
<li>You can put other words in brackets too, but they will be ignored.<br>
<b>Example:</b> "Testgame (ItalyVsRussiaVsGermany)" will work too.</li>
<li>You can use one or more "?" to mark a random country. After the game starts the "?" will be replaced with a country letter and all other players get their countries randomly.<br>
<b>Example:</b> "Testgame (?I??)" will open a game with Italy and 3 random countries.</li>
</ul>
<b>Attention:</b><ul>
<li>If there is only one country (or none) recognized it will open a standard classic game with 7 players.<br>
<li>If your game-name has more brackets it will check everything between the first "(" and the last ")" for your possible countries.<br>
<b>Example:</b> "Testgame (I like this variant) you too? (FranceVsGermany)" will open a 4-player game with Italy, a random country, France and Germany.</li>
<li>If I find a better way to program the variant I might have to delete all old games played on the server.</li>
</ul>
