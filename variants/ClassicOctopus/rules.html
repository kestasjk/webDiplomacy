<p><b>Rules:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>This variant is based on the standard Diplomacy map. Except as noted below, the standard rules apply.</li>
<li>Every army and fleet have a double movement. This means that they can move to, or support, any adjacent territory, <u>or</u> any territory adjacent to the latter.</li>
<li>The standard rules concerning the distinction between army and fleet movements remain valid. For example, a fleet in Mao can move to Nth (2 sea movements) or to Mar (2 coastal movements), or to Wal (1 sea and 1 coastal movement), but it cannot move to Par (fleet movement forbidden in inland territories).</li>
<li>The units can move to the desired territory independently on the presence of friendly or enemy units in the territories through which they intend to pass. In the previous example, the fleet in Mao can move to Mar even if there is a unit in Spa.</li>
<li>The standard rules concerning supporting and bouncing remain valid; in particular, two units cannot exchange their position by attacking each other: they will bounce.</li>
<li>The same abovementioned rules apply to the convoy orders, with these specifications:
<ol>
a. a fleet can convoy only if it is in a sea-zone;</ol>
<ol>
b. a fleet can convoy an army <u>from and to every sea-zone that it could reach in that turn</u>.</ol>
For example, a fleet in Hel can convoy an army from Bel to Swe, regardless of the presence of a unit in Nth or Den. This rule generates a convoy-through-the-coast paradox in all the cases (as that in the previous example) in which a fleet could move to a territory through a coast: as the example shows, in this case the convoy is valid, and the fleet can convoy through Den.</li>
</ol>
