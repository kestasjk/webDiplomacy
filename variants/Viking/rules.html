	<li><b>Map Notes:</b><ul>
		<li>Hedeby is a channel province, just like Kiel in standard.</li>
		<li>Oerne(and Kalmar) is a channel too, and armies can move to Kalmar, Jylland and Hedeby without convoy. </li>
		<li>Fleets in the waterways labelled "Volga route" and "Dnepr route" may convoy armies. The armies can only be convoyed along the waterway, not across the river (e.g. a fleet in Gardarike may convoy an army from Kjonugard to Holmgard, but not from Smolensk to Mordvin).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Armed Neutrals:</b><br>
		There are 5 armies defending the neutral SC's at Buda, Pest, London, Jorsal and Alexandria.<br>
		They order:<br><ul>
			<li>London => Hold</li>
			<li>Buda => Suport Hold Pest</li>
			<li>Pest => Suport Hold Buda</li>
			<li>Jorsal => Suport Hold Alexandria</li>
			<li>Alexandria => Suport Hold Jorsal</li>
		</ul>
		If dislodged, they retreat off the board.<br>
		They will only do the support if they unit they support is a holding neutral as well.
