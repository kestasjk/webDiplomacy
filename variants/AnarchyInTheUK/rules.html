<b>Settings and History:</b><br>
In the bleak dystopian future of the year 2000, when Margret Thatcher never stepped <br>
down from government, continuing to oppress the working class and keeping the punk <br>
movement alive. Eventually, the country, crippled by austerity and overbearing taxes, <br>
descended into anarchy. nobody quite knows how it happened but when the dust settled, <br>
the country had split into different areas, with Scotland gaining Independence and  <br>
sealing their borders, and these city states and areas manage to start enforcing their <br>
own laws and pacifying the surrounding regions. There's still a lot of anarchy out there <br>
though, and other factions to be dealt with. Are you a bad enough dude to re-unite whats <br>
left of England? <br>
