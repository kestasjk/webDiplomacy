<p>This is the first in a series of known-world variants that I plan on developing. As David E. Cohen had already created a 901AD version; I thought that I would start my series by translating his epic work into PhP. Enjoy!</p>
<p>This map is build anywhere and has neutral standing armies that disband when dislodged, but will be rebuild if the relevant Home Supply Center is vacant and unowned during the build-phase in autumn. I have taken the decision to add a transform option, where players can change their fleets to armies, or armies to fleets, provided they are on a coast with a supply center, and haven't been attacked that season.</p>
