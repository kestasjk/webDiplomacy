<p>This is the first in a series of known-world variants that I plan on developing. As David E. Cohen had already created a 901AD version; I thought that I would start my series by translating his epic work into PhP. Enjoy!</p>
<p>This map is build anywhere and has neutral standing armies that disband when dislodged. I have taken the decision to add a transform option, where players can change their fleets to armies, or armies to fleets, provided they are on a coast with a supply center, and haven't been attacked that season.</p>
