<p><b>Diplomacy Bidding Start:</b></p>
<ol><li>
Each nation starts with their capital city and four tokens to bid for other home centers with. All of the
players reveal their bids at once for the biding phase. If a player is the only player to have bid on a supply center then that
supply center becomes a home center of that player. If two players bid on the same supply center the player who bid the
most on the supply center gets it as their home center. If they bid the same amount on the supply center then the supply
center remains neutral. All Supply Centers that become a nation's Home Centers will have either a navy or army in the 
territory (See the original description below for a full list. - Example: if Sparta bids on and gets Cor then that Home Center will start the 
normal game with a F on the east coast of Cor).
