<li><b>The Underworld:</b>
<br>The Haven is played both above and below ground. The underground passages are connected to the overworld at 5 points - one in each corner, and one in the center.
<br>A unit in a crossover space exists on both maps. A crossover space is connected (via land, for army movement only) to all spaces adjacent to it in both worlds. For example, an army in Yggdrasil (underground) could support a fleet moving from Thon Tholas (overworld) to Cave of Ordeals (both worlds). But once the fleet occupied the Cave of Ordeals, it could not move into either underground space - only an army could do that.
<br>The crossover spaces are:
</li><ul>
<li>Mount Nimro (center)</li>
<li>Cave of Ordeals (northwest)</li>
<li>Dragons Teeth Mountains (northeast)</li>
<li>Hoarluk (southwest)</li>
<li>Nowwhat (southeast) </li>
</ul>
<li><b>The Eternal Build Centers:</b>
<br>There are 9 special centers on the board, designed to create hot spots and extremely desireable centers to capture. This is because any power may build in one of the 9 eternal build centers!
<br>The 9 eternal build centers are:
</li><ul>
<li>Telmar (northwest)</li>
<li>Spiral Castle (northeast)</li>
<li>Dargaard Keep (west)</li>
<li>The Julianthes (central / island)</li>
<li>Myth Drannor (central / island)</li>
<li>Never Never Land (east)</li>
<li>Whoville (southwest)</li>
<li>Krikkit (southeast)</li>
<li>Spirit Pond (underworld) </li>
</ul>
<li><b>The Rivers:</b><br>
Rivers are marked by blue lines on the map, and function like the standard game canals in Constantinople and Kiel. A fleet may move into a space that contains or is along a river, and may cross thru that space provided it moves to an adjacent space also connected to the river. 
</li>
<li><b>Province Names:</b><br>
The names are taken from over 75 fantasy books, movies, shows, games, songs, places, mythologies, fairytales, folklore, and a few of them completely made up. The more you can relate to, the more you were probly a fantasy geek growing up!
