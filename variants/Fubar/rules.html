<p><b>Some Background:</b></p>
<p>The ancient kingdom of Fatflapia (ruled by the great king Fatflap) was based on a fucking weird island. This island is surrounded by some crazy smaller islands. And when i say weird and crazy i really mean weird and crazy; ever seen Lost? Well that's like the bedwetting little brother island of this island that king Fatflap rules.</p>
<p>Anyways, some sons of bitches came and fucked his shit up. That's where you come in: will you become Fatflap himself and pwn some nubs? Or will you end his reign (and stop obesity!) by becomming one of the invaders?
<p><b>Some Rules:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>This map is build anywhere.</li>
<li>This map starts with a build phase.</li>
<li>Armies can cross the territory "River" in one step (as indicated by the black arrows on the map)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tips for succesful invasion (noone cares about fatflap):</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Don't trust king Fatflap while he's still tubby, but remember he could be of great use later</li>
<li>You will probably lose if everyone builds a fleet the first turn.</li>
<li>Never become fat irl, because 5 people will come and jump you when you are chilling on your private island (try this variant if you don't believe me)</li>
</ol>
