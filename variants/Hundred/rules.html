<li><b>Date:</b><br>
The game begins in 1425. Each turn represents 5 "real time" years, and has a movement phase followed by a retreat phase. Alternating turns will have an adjustment phase (after retreats if required), the first being in 1430.
<li><b>The starting units of France:</b><br>
To represent the reliance on underpaid mercenary units, France begins the game with more units than it can afford. The army in Provence is considered a mercenary unit, and as Provence does not start in a Supply Center, France must capture at least one Supply Center in 1425 to maintain all 5 units.  Should France fail to capture a Supply Center, it will be forced to remove one unit, however, it need not be the actual unit that starts in Provence.  Instead, if it wishes, the French ruler may discharge other troops and
keep the Provincial unit in his service.
<li><b>Build anywhere:</b><br>
A power may build in any vacant supply center it owns during an adjustment phase: there are no permanent "home centers". For example, France may build in London if it is vacant, and France owns it and is eligible for a build.</li>
<li><b>London <-> Calais:</b><br>
Units (armies and fleets) may move or give support from London to Calais or vice versa regardless of the presence of a fleet in the Strait of Dover.</li>
