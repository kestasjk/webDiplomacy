<li><b>GreyPress:</b><br>
Anonymous "grey" messages can be sent to a country or global. First click on the "Grey" tab at the top of the dialogue area. To send a grey message to a country just type the country name followed by a colon and your message. This will then be sent to just that country. To send a grey message to everyone just type global followed by a colon and your message. Anything other than this will not go anywhere and result in an error message printed in the chat window.
<br>For <b><u>PublicPress only</u></b> games you need to type grey followed by a colon in the global chat to send your message anonymous.
