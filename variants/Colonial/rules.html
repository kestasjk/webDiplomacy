<p>The Colonial Diplomacy variant of diplomacy follows the most of the rules as standard diplomacy with a modified map, and with 3 additional rules.  The game is the first commercially published true simple Diplomacy variant.</p>
     
<p><b>Rules:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Except as noted below, the standard rules of play for Diplomacy apply.</li>
<li>Cebu looks like a body of water with islands inside of it, which is accurate.  It is analogous to Kiel, Constantinople or Denmark in the standard diplomacy.</li>
<li>The Caspian Sea, Lake Baykal and any other unnamed space is not passable.</li>
<li>This version of Colonial is based on the Moulmein Convention, so land bridges have been added between Otaru and Akita, and Sakalin and Otaru.</li>
<li>Hong Kong is a British home supply center. It counts as a supply center for any country except China. If China is in possession of Hong Kong, it counts as a non-supply neutral territory. </li>
<li>The Suez-Canal rule is not implemented. Egypt is analogous to Kiel, Constantinople or Denmark in the standard diplomacy.</li>
<li>This map does not use the Trans-Siberian Railway rule.</li>
<li>There are neutral SC's on the starting map on colored territories. These SC's are marked with a neutral colored box (<img id="NSC" src="variants/Colonial/resources/sc_small.png"/>) drawn around them. Once occupied they count as any other SC.</li>
</ol>
