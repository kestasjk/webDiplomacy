	    Thanks again! It may take some time for the PayPal receipt to be registered by the server, please contact the team if you do not receive a marker.

        <p>
            webDiplomacy offers you the chance to play Diplomacy online free of charge. Our goal is to always be the best place for you to play the game of diplomacy online without 
            ever bothering you with ads, charging you for extra features, or charging you to play games. To do this we need occasional support from you. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'donations_title'>How do you use my donation?</div>
    <div class = 'donations_content'>
        <p>
           Donations are mainly used to pay for the cost of the server, domain, and maintenance costs. The owners, admins, and moderators do not take a salary and never will. 
           Leftover funds may be used for development of features such as our email service to confirm new members in bulk. 
           Your contribution is only ever used for the betterment of webDiplomacy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'donations_title'>Why don't you get ad revenue, sell user data, or charge for premium features?</div>
    <div class = 'donations_content'>
        <p>
           <em>We do not believe that it is right to distract you with obnoxious advertisements, sell your private data to third parties, or charge you for extra features. We are an 
           entirely free, safe-to-use site and always will be. *</em><br /><br />

           * 2025-06-02: This was written as a student a long time ago, and was maintained for two decades.. Unfortunately the reality of having a full-time job as a software
           developer, having a family and mortgage, having clients with a queue of paid development tasks, means time spent on this project is expensive, which makes 
           the above a bit unsustainable if the project/site is going to be developed / maintained.<br /><br />
           This means we are now looking at ways to fund the project, so unfortunately the above will change. Any revenue raising
           measures introduced will be done with the aim of keeping the site free to use, growing the hobby, and not
           being obnoxious / intrusive.<br /><br />

           Note we have provided redacted and anonymized press/messages to research organizations to allow for the training of AI models and research, under
           strict NDAs with time limits. This helps fund the project, and is what lets us run our full-press AI bots (including the two very expensive 4090 GPUs
           required to run them).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'donations_title'>What do I get for donating?</div>
    <div class = 'donations_content'>
        <p>
           We will give you a marker on your profile and on the forum to signify your support for the site. However we never want our members to feel obligated to contribute so no 
           functionality is locked behind a paywall, nor do we ever discriminate in any way against those who have not donated. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'donations_title'>Do I have to donate?</div>
    <div class = 'donations_content'>
        <p>
           No, donations are optional. We will never require a user to donate in order to gain any perks, play more games, or enjoy our full site.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = 'donations_title'>How do I donate?</div>

        <p>
            If you would like to support the site, click the button below. You will receive a donation marker so that other users are aware that you are helping to keep the site we all enjoy up and running.</br>
