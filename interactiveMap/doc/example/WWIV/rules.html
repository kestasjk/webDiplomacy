<li><b>Home supply centers:</b><br>Units may be built on any vacant supply center that has been held for a fall. (i.e. all supply centers controlled by players are considered their "home supply centers" for the purpose of building units)</li>
<li><b>The first turn: builds</b><br>The game starts with a build phase for every power.</li>
<li><b>Special kick-out after first build:</b><br>If a player does not check in during the first build phase his status is immediately set to "Left" and the country gets a "default build" so another player can take over in this early stage.</li>
<li><b>Globe:</b><br>The map is a globe, so you can leave the map on the left side and enter at the right side.</li>
