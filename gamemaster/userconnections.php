     * Judging and Matching Optimizer
 * ==============================
 * 
 * Data-structures and processing
 * ==============================
 * This section gives an example going from the collected data to the aggregated data. This is stored across three tables:
 * wD_UserCodeConnections - For each user, code type, and code it has the earliest and latest use of that code, and a count of times it was used
 * wD_UserCodeConnectionMatches - For each code type and pair of users which both used the same code contains how many codes matched, and how many times that code was used
 * wD_UserConnections - For each user has a summary of the counts and matches for each code type
 * 
 * This data is aggregated and collected by running gamemaster.php from the commandline with the argument CONNECTIONUPDATE. 
 * It uses wD_Misc.LastConnectionUpdate to know what time it should start collecting new codes from (if 0 it will start from scratch),
 * and uses wD_Misc.LastMessageID to know what game message it should start collecting new message data from.
 * The script takes 10-20 minutes to run from scratch against a large webDiplomacy.net sized system, but every time it runs subsequently
 * it only processes new records and runs very quickly. The datasets generated can be searched and analyzed without locking any live 
 * datasets.
 * 
 * 
 * wD_UserCodeConnections
 * ----------------------
 * The count of hits per user per code, with the earliest and latest instance of the code use. Data is collected from the
 * access logs, game membership records, NMR records, game messages, and aggregated into this table.

 * 
 * Code types
 * ==========
 * Codes are various bits of data relating to an account that tend to overlap when accounts are related. e.g. Cookie codes are from randomly generated 
 * cookies that get stored in users browsers; if two accounts share the same cookie codes it indicates they were using the same browser.
 * 
 * However these days everyone is aware of cookies, there are lots of tools for managing them etc, so they have limited use. Similarly IP addresses 
 * are less useful than they once were with VPNs cheap and easy to use.
 * This means many methods have to be used together to get an indication of whether accounts are related. If a user changes cookie codes / IPs constantly, 
 * that raises the suspicion about that indicator.
 * 
 * fingerprint.js and fingerprint-pro.js are used to generate fingerprint codes that match against a certain browser, like a cookie code but much harder 
 * to hide and mask.
 * 
 * Then there are codes like UserTurn, which just track gameIDs. This will generate many matches that aren't suspicious, but can be used to indicate 
 * whether user accounts share an unusually large number of games. UserTurnMissed matches a gameID and turn that the player missed, which if two players
 * miss at the same time can be a good indicator. At the same time if an account misses turns when the other doesn't and has no matches that can be a
 * negative indicator (against multi-accounting) as it implies the multi-accounter intentionally missed an order submission with one account but not 
 * another, which would take a lot of care.
 * 
 * Similarly the MessageCount and MessageLength codes match the number of messages and number of message characters that users have shared within a game.
 * If this is unusually little for a pair that indicates they are communicating outside the game, or don't need to communicate. If the average message 
 * lengths are different overall that is a negative indicator (for multi-accounting), as it implies the multi-accounter has a different messaging style
 * across two accounts.
 * 
 * IPs are looked up with a VPN lookup service which gives IP location info and whether the IP runs a VPN. This can be used to tell if a user is appearing
 * from all over the globe, if two IPs come from the same area, and if IPs being used are associated with a VPN.
 * 
 * Some codes like LatLon/Network/City aren't matched as it would generate too many matches, but are just provided as extra info.
 * 
 * => Matched:
 * Cookie - Randomly generated number that gets stored in a cookie
 * IP - IP address, IPv4/IPv6
 * IPv6 => '2409:8a00:184f:70d0:652f:47b3:7ee1:5f50' $ip=str_replace(':','',$ip); '24098a00184f70d0652f47b37ee15f50'
 * IPv4 => $ip = ip2long($ip); if( !$ip ) $ip = 0; $ip = dechex($ip);
 * Fingerprint - fingerprint.js free library that generates a fingerprint for the user's browser and sends it back to the site
 * FingerprintPro - fingerprint pro 3rd party API that generates a fingerprint externally with some secret sauce etc, and sends it from the server to the site
 * UserTurn - The game ID the user was in for a turn UNHEX(LPAD(CONV(gameID,10,16),16,'0'))
 * UserTurnMissed - The game ID * 1000 + the game turn that the user missed a.gameID*1000 + a.turn UNHEX(LPAD(CONV(gameIDTurn,10,16),16,'0'))
 * 
 * => Not matched
 * MessageCount - The user ID a game message was sent to, for every message UNHEX(LPAD(CONV(otherUserID,10,16),16,'0'))
 * MessageLength - The user ID a game message was sent to, for every character UNHEX(LPAD(CONV(otherUserID,10,16),16,'0'))
 * IPVPN - A UTF-8 string indicating an IP is associated with a vpn, relay, or proxy from the IP lookup
 * LatLon - Lat/Lon from the IP lookup UNHEX(LPAD(CONV(ROUND((u.latitude+90.0)*10,0)*10000+ROUND((u.longitude+180.0)*10,0),10,16),16,'0'))
 * Network - Network subnet from the IP lookup UNHEX(LPAD(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(network,':',''),'/',''),'.',''),16,'0'))
 * City - A UTF-8 string containing the city from the IP lookup
 * 
 * 
 * Match parameters
 * ================
 * For each code matched there are various things to take into account:
 * - What type of match is it? A UserTurn match is much less significant than a FingerprintPro match.
 * - How many other users does the user share this code with? If a code is common to lots of users it is less of a strong indicator.
 * - How many non-matching codes does the user not share? If there are lots of unmatched codes and only a few matched it is less strong.
 * - How many times was the matching code used? If very rarely that is less of an indicator, if it is used most of the time that is a stronger indicator.
 * - For users that have a matching code how many *other* users does that user have a matching code with? If a matching user also matches with hundreds of 
 * other users that is less of a strong indicator than if a matching user doesn't match with anyone else.
 * - For users that have a matching code how many times did that user use the code? If the other user rarely used that code it is less of an indicator.
 * 
 * Within a certain code match there are other details:
 * - What is the overlap time for the matching code? Has it matched over a long period of time, or just for a short period?
 * - What is the overlap time for all the matching codes? Does it make up a fairly continuous sequence of matches across different codes, or do the codes
 * used not match up in terms of when they were used? A cookie code match where one user used the code today and the other used it 10 years ago is less of
 * an indicator than a match where both users matched at the same time.
 * 
 * 
 * Other information
 * =================
 * Also feeding into the system are the daily usage pattern. The times and frequency that the site accessed over the day is tracked and given in 24 hour
 * slices. This can be used to indicate whether users are likely in the same timezone, and whether they access the site during the same periods with the
 * same frequency. To work around this indicator a multi-accounter would have to log on to their alternate account during early hours of the morning, and
 * never use their other account during certain hours, as the early morning period from 2-5am is usually very conspicuous for an account.
 * 
 * Other indicators that help correlate users are the e-mail address; is the e-mail a regular looking one, or does it look like a throwaway. Do the join 
 * times match.
