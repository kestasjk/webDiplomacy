/**
 * The main class behind paradox detection and the non-trivial stuff in the adjudicator.
 *
 * Understanding how paradoxes are solved is key to understanding this adjudicator. Other than
 * the paradoxes it's all pretty simple.
 *
 *
 * This is the main class involved in Diplomacy phase adjudication. The DATC algorithm didn't
 * touch on implementation too much; they suggested a recursive algorithm like the one employed
 * here, but when it came to solving paradoxes it was suggested that the code for finding
 * dependencies be separate from the recursive code, despite the fact that both have similar
 * functionality.
 *
 * In webDip the paradox resolution code and decision code is the same; there is no Undecided
 * status for a decision. webDip instead uses exceptions to handle paradoxes.
 *
 * - When a decision detects that it has looped back onto itself it throws a paradox exception,
 *   this is what is meant when referring to "paradox" from here on: A chain of dependencies which
 *   loops back on itself creating a dependency cycle.
 *
 * - When a paradox is caught in a dependencyNode one of three things can happen:
 *
 *		- Re-throw/Ignore
 * 		  A paradox may be re-thrown, i.e. ignored.
 * 		  e.g. If decision A calls decision B which calls decision C which calls decision A, then
 * 		  a paradox is thrown to C. If C does not find an alternative method of coming to a decision
 * 		  without running into a paradox it will then pass the paradox on up to decision B. If decision
 * 		  B can't find an alternative way of dealing with the paradox it'll get passed up to decision A.
 * 		  If multiple paths throw different paradoxes the shortest paradox chain will always be
 * 		  chosen, and the longer one discarded.
 *
 * 		- Alternative non-paradox route
 * 		  An alternative way to solve the decision, which doesn't require_once solving the paradox, may
 * 		  be found. e.g. If there is a paradox in a convoy path there may be alternate convoy paths
 * 		  which do not result in the paradox, or e.g. If trying to determine if a unit has enough
 * 		  support one of the supports may result in a paradox, but knowing whether the support is
 * 		  successful may not be required.
 * 		  In the example above A calls B calls C calls A. C might be unable to handle the paradox, but
 * 		  B might be able to solve the decision without needing to call C, in which case the paradox
 * 		  exception will be discarded within B, B will return a normal value, and A will continue as if
 * 		  no paradox was ever triggered.
 *
 * 		- Explicitly resolve the paradox
 * 		  The paradox may get resolved.
 * 		  In the above example neither decision B nor C could be resolved without getting a paradox
 * 		  exception that loops through them and back to A. The paradox was thrown and re-thrown until it
 * 		  reached A.
 * 		  Once a paradox as come full loop two things are taken to be true:
 * 			- There is no way to resolve the decision without triggering a paradox
 * 			- The full, complete paradox which was caught is the shortest paradox chain that can be found
 * 		  So once a complete paradox chain is recieved the adjudicator can go no further without solving
 * 		  the paradox. At this point the exception code will look through the paradox chain to determine
 * 		  whether it is a move chain paradox or a convoy dislodge paradox, and resolve it accordingly, by
 * 		  forcing decisions within the paradox (e.g. setting moves to be successful in the event of a move chain)
 *
 * 		  Once the paradox is resolved the order is re-processed, to see if it can now be solved.
 *
 * This system has the advantage that it will find the shortest paradox chain without any extra dependency
 * searching code, no undecided state is needed, and even complex situations where a multiple distinct paradoxes
 * are found within the same decision any paradoxes which need to be solved will be solved without problem.
 *
 * To make this system work all decisions must be true/false (boolean) decisions. Any decision will either return
 * true, false, or throw a paradox.
 *
 * For this true/false based decision system the numeric "decisions" (hold strength, prevent strength,
 * attack strength and defend strength) must be true/false. For this to fit into the way webDip adjudicates
 * numeric "decisions" are replaced with comparison decisions. Instead of "what is holdStrengthMax" being a
 * decision, "is my holdStrength greater than his attackStrength" is a decision.
 * In this setup a paradox will only be created by a comparison decision if solving a comparison requires
 * solving the very same comparison.
 *
 * With numeric decisions adapted to be yes/no decisions all the decisions take the following form:
 * Can I give this decision true?
 * Can I give this decision false?
 * If neither then I must have run into a paradox, and since I am still undecided I will re-throw the paradox.
 *
 * The easiest way to see it is that "Undecided" decisions are only allowed when the decision can be undecided
 * and still allow a parent decision to be resolved.
 *
 *
 * adjDependencyNode contains the only code which will generate a new paradox exception; other code will only
 * re-throw it, never generate their own.
 * adjParadoxException is the exception object, which can collect adjDependencyNodes to be solved later, if
 * no way to find an alternative to the paradox is discovered. When the adjParadoxException has come around
 * to a complete paradox chain it must resolve the paradox.
 * The other objects can handle the adjParadoxExceptions, or ignore them, depending on whether there is a possibility
 * that the decision can still be resolved despite the paradox. All other objects *are*, however, responsible for
 * making sure that the shortest paradox found is the one which is re-thrown, if any. If a longer paradox is
 * re-thrown the paradox resolving code may interfere with decisions which don't need to be interfered with to resolve
 * the paradox.
 *
 *
 * adjDependencyNode also catches any paradox thrown from the decision, and will check if the paradox is complete,
 * before either solving it or re-throwing it. adjDependencyNode also provides an interface for adjParadoxException
 * to explicitly set decision values, so that when that decision is next called instead of being normally resolved
 * the decision will return the value which the paradox resolver explicitly set, thus avoiding the paradox.
 *
 * If the decision logic code itself, which is called from adjDependencyNode's __call(), has no code to handle a
 * paradox, then alternative solutions which do not involve the paradox will never be found; any paradox will cause
 * the decision to pass the paradox on.
 *
 *
 * Once you understand all of the above, and have flicked through DATC chapter 5, you should have a good idea of how
 * this adjudicator works.

		 *
		 * - A yes/no call, to decide whether a certain value is yes/no
