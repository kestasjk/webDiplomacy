IMPORTANT NOTE: 
===========================**=====**=====**===============================

FusionCharts Free is not the evaluation of FusionCharts v3.

FusionCharts Free is an open-source Flash charting component which originally
was FusionCharts v2.3. It is intended to take care of all your basic charting needs. 
FusionCharts v3, on the other hand, has a lot more features and chart types that
you may see and download from http://www.fusioncharts.com

FusionCharts Free and FusionCharts v3 can both be used for personal or
commercial purposes. However, if you have downloaded FusionCharts Free for 
evaluation purposes, we recommend that you download FusionCharts v3 evaluation 
from www.fusioncharts.com/download. This is because the feature set is more 
advanced in FusionCharts v3. Additionally, FusionCharts v3 provides  
seamless upgrade from all previous versions of FusionCharts, including 
FusionCharts Free.

===========================**=====**=====**===============================

How do I install?
==================

"Installation" page to get instructions on how to install FusionCharts 
Free and use it in your projects.

I'm a non-technical user. How do I get started?
===============================================

pages, please run Index.html and read through the pertinent section.

Or, if you're using Dreamweaver to create your websites, you might want to take
a look at FusionCharts for Dreamweaver. It allows you to build charts from the Design 
View in Dreamweaver itself, without having to write even a line of code.

I want to use FusionCharts Free in my blogs. How can I?
================================================================
If you're familiar with HTML and JavaScript, you can upload the SWF
files to your blog and then build charts using HTML code (as explained
in our documentation).

Or, if you're NOT comfortable with code, you may use FusionCharts
Google Gadget for Free at www.fusioncharts.com/GG to build such charts
for your blogs, without having to write a line of code.

Where can I get support on this?
================================
At this point in time, we do not provide personalized support for 
FusionCharts Free. However, you may visit our forums at 
www.fusioncharts.com/forum to get support from our vibrant community.

I've started using FusionCharts Free. Can I upgrade to FusionCharts v3?
=======================================================================
Yes - very much. FusionCharts v3 is totally backward compatible with 
FusionCharts Free. So all code that you've written with FusionCharts Free
will work with FusionCharts v3. All you need to do is download/purchase
FusionCharts v3 from www.fusioncharts.com and replace the old SWF files
with new ones, and then rename either the SWF itself, or the file names in 
your code.

How can I build some of the advanced charts, gauges and maps that I 
see in your gallery at www.fusioncharts.com/gallery?
=======================================================================

license of our products. We offer 4 core products that provide different types of charts, gauges
