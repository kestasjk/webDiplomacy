JavaScript in webDiplomacy
--------------------------

Uses
----
JavaScript is used in webDiplomacy for three things mainly:
- Processing static, cached HTML to be suited to the user viewing it
	- Altering timestamps for a user's timezone
	- Turning on user-online icons for the users currently online
	- Turning on the new-message icons for new messages
	- Counting down time-remaining values correctly
	- Italicizing posts made by the user viewing messages
- Generating valid orders for the user to select from, and submitting them
- Extra neat features
	- Hovering over a game title on the home page filters out notices from that game
	- The FAQ and "New thread" button in the forum
	- Allowing the map image history of a game to be scrolled through

Prototype framework
-------------------
The Prototype framework is used to make this functionality possible as 
easily as possible, and pretty much all of the JavaScript we use can't 
be properly understood without some understanding of Prototype.
- When processing static, cached HTML it is used to select the HTML elements 
	which need to be updated, and is used to hide()/show() various elements and
	alter their styles as required.
- In generating valid orders it is used extensively to filter out sets. e.g.
	Selecting the list of borders a territory links to, filtering out which ones 
	are coastal borders, applying a function to filter out which of these can be
	supported into by a certain third unit, then getting the names of the 
	territories from the list of territory objects. This sort of thing is made 
	very easy using Prototype's "Enumerable" class functionality.
	
JavaScript Code
---------------
JavaScript code is mostly all bundled into the javascript folder. Because many 
web browsers cache JavaScript and this causes problems when there is a bug in
JavaScript code it has been made easy to change the location of the javascript 
folder, so that after a change it can be renamed and no issues with old, cached
code will persist.
The server defined JSDIR as the location of the javascript directory in 
global/definitions.php

Within the javascript folder there is:
utility.js 
	- Handles JS errors, submitting them to the server for logging
	- Makes text entry forms on the forum and board safer by making users confirm 
		before leaving a page when they have an unsubmitted comment.
timeHandler.js
	- Updates timestamps to be in the users timezone, in the static HTML all 
		timestamps are GMT/UTC
	- Updates countdown timers to make them countdown in 
		real time. 
home.js
	- Contains JavaScript which only runs on index.php, such as the JS which filters
		notices out for a certain game.
mapUI.js
	- Alters the board map, allowing old turns to be shown using the back/forward arrows, 
		and the large map button.
forum.js
	- Contains JavaScript which only runs in forum.php, allowing posting and forum 
		traversal more efficiently/quickly without needing constant page refreshes. 
cacheUpdate.js
	- Contains the general purpose code which runs through all HTML on the page, updating 
		it to be from the perspective of the current user.
	- User-online icons are shown based on an array of online users saved to 
		cache/onlineUsers.json by gamemaster.php 
	- Message icons on the forum and homepage updated depending on whether the current 
		user has viewed the message.
	- Messages from the viewing user italicized
	
board/ 
	- Contains code which represents board/game data; providing a data-structure which
		can be used to easily generate orders or draw dynamic data to the map.
board/territories.js
	- Loads the basic data which represents territories and borders.
board/model.js
	- Loads the classes into which the raw territory and unit data will be loaded.
	- These classes manage things like finding adjacant units/territories, used to 
		generate orders.
	- If in Diplomacy phase loads the class which will allow convoy groups to be enumerated.
board/load.js
	- Loads the raw data into the model, preparing the board data for use:
	- Loads terrstatus data (who owns which country, standoffs, etc) into the territories
		data-structure
	- Loads units data (saved to a JSON file in cache/games/123/12345/) into their own 
		class, and loads these into the territories data-structure. Also saves all units
		owned by the viewing user into a separate list.
	- Begins phase-specific tasks: 
		- Diplomacy: Iterates through coastal armies to get groups of convoyable locations
			for order generation.
		- Retreats: Loads standoff territories into a separate list.
		- Builds: Loads supply-center territories into a separate list

orders/order.js
	- Contains the class which contains an order's data
	- Contains the function which loads basic order data into the order class and initializes. 
		This usually involves linking into the relevant board/* datastructure to allow it to be 
		easily queried.
	- Draws the form HTML, with the valid order options, and refreshes it when different options
		are selected. Also controls whether an individual order segment has changed, coloring 
		changed and unsaved segments a red shade.
	- The order segments available to be changed are: type, toTerr, fromTerr, viaConvoy. The 
		valid options for each of these segments depend on:
		- Previous segments
		- The phase the game is in
		- The unit/board context (who surrounds the unit etc)
		Because generating these options varies significantly depending on the phase the code
		for generating them for each phase is contained in separate files, which extend the 
		generic order class for that specific phase.
orders/phaseDiplomacy.js
	- Extends the order class for the Diplomacy phase. 
	- type = Hold/Move/Support-hold/Support-move/Convoy
orders/phaseRetreats.js
	- Retreats phase. type = Retreat/Disband
orders/phaseBuilds.js
	- Builds phase. type = Build-army/Build-fleet/Wait/Destroy
orders/form.js
	- Handles order submission:
	- Manages the complete, loaded list of the user's orders.
	- Keeps tabs on whether orders are completed and ready for finalization, whether 
		the player is currently finalzied, whether new, unsaved order data is present, etc. 
		This data is used to show the correct Save/Ready buttons beneath the order form, and 
		to respond correctly whent they are clicked.
	- On submission it will send a request to ajax.php, wait for a response, and display that 
		response appropriately; updating whether currently finalized/saved, displaying moves 
		which had errors occur, and updating the order-status icon throughout the board page.
		If there is a server-side error it will display it textually, allowing the user to 
		re-submit their orders if appropriate.

Server-side code
----------------
libHTML::$footerIncludes
	An array of JavaScript files in the JavaScript folder which are to be loaded in the footer.
	Used to load JavaScript files which are only relevant to a certain page in certain 
	circumstances; e.g. mapUI.js, home.js, forum.js, etc
libHTML::$footerScript
	An array of JavaScript code strings which is output in the footer, and will run when the DOM is 
	loaded. Can rely on the Prototype framework being available, and all of $footerIncludes[] 
	being loaded, and the entire page DOM being loaded, but not on all resources e.g. images
	being loaded.
	Often used to call functions in JavaScript included via $footerIncludes, which often relies 
	on the page being loaded and Prototype being available before being run.

ajax.php
	The main place where JavaScript code dynamically interacts with the server. Tries to load a 
	slimmed down webDiplomacy environment, with no user logon; user credentials have to be 
	specified using a token rather than authenticated via user/password.
	Via utility.js any runtime errors that occur in the JavaScript are logged silently via ajax.php
	providing debugging info.
	orders/form.js interacts with ajax.php to submit orders, using JSON token data to authenticate
	as a certain country with control over certain orders without having to authenticate the user
	first.
