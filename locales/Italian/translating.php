<h4>One-language translation</h4>

<p>
Unfortunately webDiplomacy doesn't yet have built-in translation support; so the easiest way to translate webDiplomacy is
to download the source from <a class="light" href="http://webdiplomacy.net/developers.php">here</a>, and replace all the English
text with translated text.
</p>

<p>
After doing this your new version of webDiplomacy will provide a great web-Diplomacy experience in the language you
translated to; you can use your code to start up a new webDiplomacy site for speakers of your language, or send the code
to me at kestas.j.k@gmail.com and I will host it for you!
</p>

<h4>Multi-langauge translation</h4>

<p>
Alternatively, if you're up for a challenge and know some PHP you can help code built-in translation support; this will
allow English speakers to view a site in English, while at the same time allowing French speakers to view the same server
in French. However despite there being some code in place to make built-in translations possible this would be quite a
lot of work to do well!<br />
But if you're not deterred by that, and want to bring your favorite webDiplomacy community to more people, you can get
the code and the help you need <a class="light" href="http://webdiplomacy.net/developers.php">here</a>.
