<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<p>To get a patch submitted first check that the idea is okay. If it's not in the todo-list at forum.webdiplomacy.net post
it to the ideas section.</p>

<p>Once the patch is done post a link to a demo site where it's working, along with the code, and it'll get
added in once it has been checked.</p>
