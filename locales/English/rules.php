<a name="Rights"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/tick.png" alt=" " /> Rights:</h3>
<ul><li>Mods &amp; admins take a relaxed approach to rule enforcement based on mutual respect for other players.</li>
<li>Mods &amp; admins keep an objective view when they have to enforce rules.</li>
<li>Mods &amp; admins give the benefit of the doubt to a reasonable degree.</li>

<a name="Responsibilities"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/alert_minor.png" alt=" " /> Responsibilities:</h3>
<ul><li>Use common sense and respect other players.</li>
<li>Help the mods &amp; admins keep our server fun.</li>
<li>Don't abuse the software to gain an edge in online games that isn't possible in a real-life.</li>
<li>Keep up to date with the rules and <a href="faq.php" class="light">FAQ</a> to make things easier for us.</li>
<li>Protect your account with a strong password and a secure account e-mail address.</li>
</ul>

<div class="hr"></div>

<a name="Rules"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/alert.png" alt=" " /> Rules:</h3>
<h4>1. No Multi-Accounting</h4>
<p>
  You may only have <em>one account</em>, second accounts are not allowed under <em>any circumstances</em>, and will be banned. This may also lead to your first account also being banned.&nbsp; If you forget your password, use the lost password finder <a class="light" href="logon.php?forgotPassword=1">here</a>. If you are still unable to log in, contact the mods.
</p>

<h4>2. No Meta-gaming</h4>
<p>
  You can't make alliances <em>for reasons outside a game</em>, such as because you are friends, relatives or in return for a favour in another game.&nbsp; This is known as metagaming and is against the rules because it gives an unfair advantage to those involved.&nbsp; If you are worried that you can't stab someone because you want to stay friends, then that's fair enough but you can't join a game with them.
</p>

<h4>3. Don't work around game messaging/press rules.</h4>
<p>
  If you enter a game with limited press/messaging (such as global-only) then <em>you can't use other methods</em> such as email or PM to bypass this.
</p>

<h4>4. Do not use the software or moderators as a diplomacy tactic</h4>
<p>
  Lying is fine in Diplomacy <em>except when it gives mods/admins unnecessary work to do!</em><br /><br />
  Falsely accusing someone of being a multi-accounter/meta-gaming to rally others against them in a game, or claiming that your orders didn't
  come out the way you entered them to cover up your motives, means mods/admins spend time looking for cheaters/bugs which were made up.<br /><br />

  All accusations against other players must be made directly to the mod/admin team directly as specified below, <em>in private</em>, for this reason, and software bug claims
  <em>must be genuine</em>, even if only told to another player.
</p>

<h4>5. The Pause/Unpause feature is not a diplomatic tool</h4>
<p>
  The pause is there to stop players missing their orders, but is <em>not part of the game</em>.&nbsp; As such pausing or unpausing should not be used for diplomatic gain, such as refusing to unpause unless other players will draw the game.&nbsp; If it is being abused staff may step in to sort it out.
</p>

<h4>6. You may not access another player's account without permission</h4>
<p>
  In general, account sitting (getting someone you trust to log on as you and issue orders when you are unable to) is encouraged.&nbsp; However, you must not get a sitter or sit for somebody you share games with. Also, anything done by the sitter whilst on your account is your responsibility, so make sure you're happy with that before you give them your password.<br />
  It is also <em>your responsibility</em> to change your password after allowing someone to use your account.
</p>
<h4>7. Do not spam the forum or private messaging system</h4>
<p>
  You are welcome and indeed encouraged to join in with the community but be sensible.&nbsp; Try to keep replies relevant to the conversation and don't start too many threads at once. Before posting a question relating to the software please read the <a href="faq.php" class="light">FAQ</a>.
</p>
<h4>8. You must answer communication from site staff</h4>
<p>
  You must answer any warnings or other messages sent to you by the moderators, because if you don't reply it will be assumed you have something to hide, and your account may be closed.&nbsp; As part of this, you <em>must make sure</em> that the email address provided is one you still check, because this normally how staff will communicate with you.
</p>
<h4>9. Follow common sense</h4>
<p>
  The rules above are mainly ones which might not be obvious; just because a specific rule isn't given here doesn't mean
  moderators can't stop people ruining the server for others!

<a name="silenceInfo"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/unmute.png" alt=" " title="An icon indicating someone isn't muted; use this to mute people" /> Forum moderation:</h3>

<h4><img src="images/icons/mute.png" alt=" " title="An icon indicating someone is muted; use this to unmute people" /> Self-moderation:</h4>
<p>
A user-driven approach is generally taken to forum moderation;
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>mute any other user</em> which you don't want to see in the forum or get PMs from.</li>
<li>You can <em>mute any forum thread</em> you aren't interested in.</li>
<li>You can <em>mute any country</em> playing in a game with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This allows you to block out anyone or any discussion you find offensive, and be as open or
restrictive in what you see as you like!
</p>

<h4><img src="images/icons/lock.png" alt=" " /> Site-moderation:</h4>
<p>
Rarely self-moderation isn't enough; e.g. threads which share information on a 
<em>private / anonymous / gunboat game</em>, or threads about 
<em>suspected multi-accounters / meta-gamers / bugs</em>.
<br /><br />
These have a negative impact on games which self-moderation can't prevent, so the 
mod team can <em>lock/silence</em> these threads:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Silences can apply to a <em>user or a thread</em>.</li>
<li>The details can be viewed on the forum page, when the "New thread" button is pressed.</li>
<li>Thread silences last indefinitely, but user silences expire after a brief <em>cool-off period</em>.</li>
<li>Silenced threads / users can <em>still be viewed</em>, however no more messages may be posted.</li>
<li>Silenced users can <em>still play in games</em>; it affects the forum only.</li>
</ul>

<p>

Remember that mods will only silence users / threads when there has been a <em>clear rule violation</em>, as
a <em>last resort</em>.<br />
If it's a <em>first time mistake</em>, and you inform the mods that you won't repeat it, they will probably
be happy to <em>reduce your cool-off period</em>!<br /><br />

Don't create new accounts to work around user silences, or post threads to continue on from 
ones which have been silenced! This may result in bans etc, which would be worse than simply 
keeping off the forum for a few days.
<br /><br />

Thanks for helping keep the forum from negatively impacting peoples' games!

<a name="Reporting"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/mail.png" alt=" " /> Contacting a mod/admin:</h3>

<h4>Why contact a mod/admin:</h4>
<p>
Mods can:</p>

<ul><li>Pause/Unpause/Draw games when a player is unavailable to vote.</li>
<li>Access months of server logs and the software to detect/analyze possible multi-accounters based on a range of criteria.</li>
<li>Ban/unban users, reset user/game passwords, give/take points, change game settings like phase length, etc.</li>
<li>Silence / unsilence forum threads and users, and reduce the cool-off period for a silenced user.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For these issues use the info below to send reports. For other issues such as bug reports, general questions, etc, you should go elsewhere (e.g. the
<a href="forum.php" class="light">built-in forum</a> or the <a href="http://forum.webdiplomacy.net/" class="light">
developer forum</a>).</p>

<h4>Where to send</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the game/user reporting tool, present at the bottom of game and user-profile pages, to lodge a report that mods will see. <i>(Currently in beta.)</i></li>
<li>
  Email the moderators at <a href="mailto:webdipmod@gmail.com" class="light">webdipmod@gmail.com</a>, <em>not their personal addresses</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to send</h4>
<p>Always try to have some clear reasons when contacting and do not mention it on the forum. In your report/email text you should include:
</p><ul>
	<li>If making a general request (e.g for an unpause):</li>
	<ul><li>
	Ensure that you make the subject line useful (e.g. "Unpausing help" or "Phaselength change") so we know we can quickly deal with it in a spare moment - if you don't it might not be solved for some time.</li>
	<li>In cases such as drawing/pausing a game standard practice is to check the global chat of the game before acting, so please get other players to post their agreement.<br />
	You don't necessarily need everyone to agree, and we will post back into the global chat when we change these settings letting you know.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If reporting a multi-accounter:
	<ul>
    <li>
      Links to the accounts of the players who you suspect. <i>(If reporting via email)</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      Link(s) to any specific game(s) that raised your suspicions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any relevant information that you have noticed.
    </li>
    <li>
      You do not have to tell us who you are, but it can be helpful. <i>(If reporting via email)</i>
    </li>
    <li>If reporting via email please make the subject line more useful than "<i>multis?</i>" Something like "<i>Multis: Username1 and Username2?</i>" is more helpful for the moderators!</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We will try to reply to you quickly, but be patient: investigations can take quite some time. If a week or two after we still haven't got back to you then feel free to follow it up.</p>
