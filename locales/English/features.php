		"You can check the variant-description of each variant using the \"Variants\"-tab.",
	"What is the best variant?" =>

	"Some player took advantage of an bug, and now the game is screwed." =>

	"Mod forum" =>
		"Instead of sending an EMail the preferred way to contact the mods is opening a thread in the <a href=\"modforum.php\">Modforum</a>.
		You can access this from the \"Mods\"-tab.
		A message postet there will alert all mods to check on this issue and you can keep track of your issue in the thread.
		You are only able to view threads you started and nobody else but the mods can see your threads there.",
	"Country switch" =>

"Game options" => "Sub-section",
	"Select your country" =>
		"When creating a game, one of the advanced options allows you to choose your country,
		choosing random will give the usual random country distribution for all players,
		however choosing a country will allow each player the pick the country they want on a first come first serve basis.",
	"Set target SC's and target end-turn" =>
		"When creating a game, one of the advanced options allows you to limit the maximum number of turns that can be played
		and/or how many SCs need to be conquered before a winner is declared.
		Please check the variant-description for information about the average turns or the default SCs for a win.
		The winning player is decided by who has the most SCs after that turn's diplomacy phase.
		If 2 or more player have the same SCs at the end of the game, the game checks for the turn before, and so on.
		If player's SC counts are the same throughout the whole game the winner is decided at random.",
	"Special NMR-CD-phase-extend" =>
		"This special rule sends a country into civil disorder (CD) if it does not enter an order (NMR) and extend the phase so a replacement can be found.

"Special votes" => "Sub-section",
	"Concede" =>
		"If everyone (but one) votes Concede the game will end and the player _not_ voting Concede will get all the points.

	"Extend" =>
		"If 2/3 of the active players vote Extend the the current phase will be extended by 4 days.
