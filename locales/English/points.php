	title="A stack of webDiplomacy points. Points are a lot like casino chips in poker; tokens to bet with" /></div>

<p class="intro">
Diplomacy is a game that takes no time to learn, but ages to master. Because webDiplomacy is
user friendly it gets many Diplomacy novices, but there are also lots of very good players.</p>

<p class="intro">
Points are what let experts play with other experts, and novices play with other novices, so
that everyone is challenged to the right amount.
</p>

<div class="hr" ></div>

<div align="center"><img src="images/points/bet.png" alt=" "
	title="All players who want to join the game bet the same amount of points when the game begins" /></div>
<p class="intro">
When someone creates a game they can select how many of their points they want to "bet" on the game.<br /><br />

Only people who can bet the same number of points can join the game.<br />
An expert player will have more points and so only other expert players can play in high-stakes games.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/points/play.png" alt=" "
	title="The game begins; all players are now fighting for the 'pot' of points which they have all bet" /></div>

<p class="intro">
Once everyone who wants to join has joined the game has a large "pot" of points. If there are seven players
the pot size will be seven times the size that each player bet.<br /><br />

Once the game is over the pot is paid back to the players depending on how well they did.
</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/points/win.png" alt=" "
	title="The game is over; the amount of points each player wins depends on their success in the game" /></div>

<p class="intro">
The amount of points you get depends on how many supply centers you have at the end. If you have the 18 supply centers needed
to win you'll get most of the points, but if you have more supply centers than you started with at the end you'll
still win something. If you get defeated, or have to leave the game, then all the points you bet are lost.

<h4>Points-per-supply-center vs Winner-takes-all</h4>
<div align="center">
	<img src="images/points/wta.png" alt=" "
		title="The winner takes all the points: Winner-takes-all" />
</div>
<p class="intro">
For more experienced players who have over 100 points there is a "Winner-takes-all" mode, which can be chosen
instead of the default "Points-per-supply-center" mode. In winner-takes-all games the winner gets all the points
from the game, and the runners up get nothing.<br />
This mode is for expert players who think that winner-takes-all is more true to the board game; there's no honor
in second place, and playing for second place makes the game worse!<br /><br />

But remember that you are less likely to get any points back in a winner-takes-all game; even if you play
well you might get no points back, so try to bet less on winner-takes-all games than points-per-supply-center
games!
</p>

<h4>Draws</h4>
<div align="center">
	<img src="images/points/draw.png" alt=" "
		title="When all surviving players vote for a draw an equal share of the points are given to each surviving player" />
</div>
<p class="intro">
Sometimes a game can't go any further; two or more players have arranged their units so that the other players
can only hold their position. In these cases the game is a draw, and the points are split equally among all the
surviving players, regardless of how many supply centers each player has.<br /><br />

Draws can be voted for at any time; if all the players still surviving vote for a draw the points in the game will
be split up equally and a share given to each player still surviving. (In a draw a surviving player with 15 supply-centers will
get the same number of points as a surviving player with only one!)
</p>

<a name="minpoints"></a>
<h4>Minimum points</h4>
<p class="intro">
New players get only 100 points to start out with, but don't worry about losing all your points! If a game ends and
you have less than 100 points (including the points you have bet into any other games which you're still playing in) then
you get topped back up to your starting 100 points!
</p>

<h4>Discipline!</h4>
<p class="intro">
As players win more points they can enter games that cost more points, and climb up the ladder towards the
expert players. But in high stakes games you can gain and lose lots of points very quickly, so be careful
about betting all your points!<br />
If you're getting a good collection of points try to limit yourself to
betting half your points at a time, especially against the expert players, or you could be back to playing with
novices!
